# Mission
Brick@Heart's mission is to support the AFOL community through the delivery of software that makes communication and management easier. 

# The Repos

## Baseplate / BaseplateDB
The Baseplate and BaseplateDB repositories provide the foundation for the rest of the software that Brick@Heart provides. Baseplate is a collection of APIs, which provide the functionality needed to manage a LEGO&reg; User Group (LUG). BaseplateDB is the default data store used by Baseplate.

## Headlight
Headlight utilizes Baseplate, and provides a user interface for graphically interacting with Baseplate.

# Support 
The software, including source code, is provided freely. Brick@Heart will never charge for the use of the software it provides. Instead it relies on sponsorships and donations from the community to carry out its mission.
