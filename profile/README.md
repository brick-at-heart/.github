# Mission
Brick@Heart's mission is to support the AFOL community through the delivery of software that makes communication and management easier. 

# The Repos

## Baseplate.Shared
A shared library of data entities and data client methods which serves as the contract for all data access for Brick@Heart software. 

## Baseplate.SqlServerDataClient
A SQL Server specific implement of the interfaces declared in Baseplate.Shared. This is the default implementaion used through Brick@Heart software.

## Baseplate.SqlServerDataStore
A database project which contains the definition of 99% of the objects used in a SQL Server data store for Brick@Heart software.

## Minifig
The token store used by Brick@Heart software for authentication. This service is used for access to Plate and Tile, but does not handle permissions within the software.

## Plate
A series of web application programming interfaces (API) used for maintaining a LEGO&reg; community.

## Tile
The defacto user-interface for Brick@Heart. It is an Angular application allowing users to manage their memberships with various LEGO&reg; communities.

# Support
The software, including source code, is provided freely. Brick@Heart will never charge for the use of the software it provides. Instead it relies on sponsorships and donations from the community to carry out its mission.
